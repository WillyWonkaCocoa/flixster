### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I run into issues creating my own custom cell. My app would crash with a "Thread 1 SIGABRT" error after I added the image view, and the cellForRowAt function never gets called. üôÅ Timothy from Codepath helped me resolve the issue through a quick exchange on Slack. Thanks Timothy!
